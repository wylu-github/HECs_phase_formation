# A simple and efficient approach to predict single-phase formation of high-entropy transition metal carbides
## 1. Empirical phase formation rules for HECs
### To establish criteria for discriminating single-phase from multi-phase systems, 50 senary HECs as “testing example” are fabricated under the same process. The 50 systems and corresponding phase compositions are listed in **50_senary_HECs.xlsx**. ###
### Mixing enthapy and lattice parameter difference can be calculated by **parameters_calculation.py**.
### The calculated results are listed in **parameters_50HECs.xlsx**
