# A simple and efficient approach to predict single-phase formation of high-entropy transition metal carbides
## 1. Empirical phase formation rules for HECs
To establish criteria for discriminating single-phase from multi-phase systems, 50 senary HECs as “testing example” are fabricated under the same process. The 50 systems and corresponding phase compositions are listed in **50_senary_HECs.xlsx**.
