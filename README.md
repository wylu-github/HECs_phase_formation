## 1. Empirical phase formation rules for HECs
#### Filename: parameters_calculation.py
#### Input: 50_senary_HECs.xlsx
#### Output: parameters_50HECs.xlsx
* To establish criteria for discriminating single-phase from multi-phase systems, 50 senary HECs as “testing example” are fabricated under the same process. The 50 systems and corresponding phase compositions are listed in **50_senary_HECs.xlsx**. <br>
* Mixing enthapy and lattice parameter difference can be calculated by **parameters_calculation.py**. <br>
* The calculated results are listed in **parameters_50HECs.xlsx** <br>
